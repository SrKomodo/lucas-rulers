      <p>Genaille-Lucas Rulers are special rulers designed to quickly do multiplication without having to do the math</p>
      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>Let's say you want to multiply 618 x 7</p>
      <p>First you put the Index, 6, 1 and 8 rulers on the table</p>
      <p>Then you follow the 7 row on the index ruler up to the right-most ruler, and go to the first number</p>
      <p>Now all you have to do is to follow the triangles from ruler to ruler, and once you get to the Index ruler just read all the numbers you passed through to get the result!</p>
